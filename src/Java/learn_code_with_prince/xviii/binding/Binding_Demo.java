    //connecting a method call to method body is known as binding
    //There are two types of binding: static binding(early) and Dynamic binding(late)
    //when type of the object is determined at compiled time, it is known as static binding
    //     if there is private, final and static method in the class, there is static binding.
    //when type of the object is determined at run-time, it is known as dynamic binding
    //     example: Animal a = new Dog(); a.eat();
